# `jregseq.jl`

This is just a playground for Tom to play around with some Julia code. This folder is in the form of a module which can be used by navigating into this folder and starting Julia. To make sure that the working directory is correct, type

`; pwd`

and confirm that the right directory is chosen. If not, the directory can be changed within the Julia REPL by simply typing `;`, followed by any command line commands. Once the right directory is selected, the module can be added to any Julia environment by switching into the pkg mode (typing `]`), followed by

`dev .`

This adds the package to the environment, allowing the user to make changes to the package locally.
